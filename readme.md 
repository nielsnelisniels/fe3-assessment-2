# FeD - Assignment 1 - Chart

### BACKGROUND
In this assesment I tried to visualize data interactively. I used data for attractions in Amsterdam and their popularity between 2012-2016. Because I thought it was to messy to put every year in one bar chart, i decided to make a chart where you can select the years. Only that specific year will be visible after choosing it in het dropdown menu. 
Because some attractions where way more popular then others, big height differences where notable. To fix this visability problem, information about the value will we visible when hovering over a specific bar in the chart. 

### DATA
In the bar chart you can find the popularity from attractions in Amsterdam between the years 2012-2016. 

* Each column on the x-axis represents the name of the attraction.
* Each column on the y-axis represents the amount of people (x1000), who have been to the attraction.

* On the top in the middle, a dropdowm menu can be selected to change the year of the data.
